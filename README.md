Hi, I’m Sara — a lifelong educator transitioning into the world of tech.

🎓 I’m currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity and building a foundation in IT through certifications like CompTIA ITF+ and A+. My focus is on developing practical skills in system support, networking, and security.

🧠 With 15+ years in education, I bring a strong background in instructional design, coaching, and problem-solving — all of which translate into the tech space.

🛠️ This GitHub is where I document my learning journey, from home lab builds and certification prep to hands-on cybersecurity projects.

💡 I’m passionate about creating secure, user-friendly systems and empowering others through knowledge — whether in classrooms or command lines.
