 Hi, I’m Sara — a passionate educator pivoting into tech.

🎓 I have a Master’s in Curriculum & Instruction and have over 15 years of experience in education, specializing in instructional coaching, special education, and data-driven teaching.

💻 I recently earned my CompTIA ITF+ certification and am studying for the CompTIA A+ to break into IT and cybersecurity. My goal is to combine my background in learning design with technical skills to make tech more accessible, secure, and human-centered.

🛠️ I'm building a personal home lab, exploring cybersecurity fundamentals, and documenting my journey here.

🚀 Future plans: Enroll at WGU for a degree in Cybersecurity or Computer Science, earn Security+, and land my first IT role in 2026.

📚 Lifelong learner. Systems thinker. Bridge-builder between education and tech.

Auction (Aug 2025), and currently earning industry certifications to pivot into IT and cybersecurity.
